    <h1>the 0 component</h1>
    <p>
        your mind is art. thoughts, ideas, words, conciousness, raindrops, snowflakes, pebbles, boulders,
        rivers, oceans, deserts, swirling around,  mixing and meshing and coming together (with a few
        corporeal elements, perhaps) to form you. yet it is an art piece with a very specific requirement to
        view: you must be you. what if this wasn't true? what if you could lay out this swirling blob of
        art for the world to see? what if there was a tool that could render your mind onto a screen?
    </p>
    <p>
        this is not a tool for that. this is an approximation of an approximation of that; a recreation
        made by an amateur inventor from only the top left corner of a blueprint. it is made up of
        components which each provide a way to get some form of something in your mind onto a screen.

        you can use all these components in turn and create something. it will not be a magic visualization
        of your mind. chances it won't resemble anything. it will be a piece of art in its own rite, however,
        and it will be viewable to all. after all, your mind is a bizarre cloud of bizarre things; why should any
        meaningless visualization of it be anything different?
